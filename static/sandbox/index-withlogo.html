      </h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Any business owner knows that not having work for long periods can make you desperate&mdash;but contacting every lead under the sun only prolongs this vicious cycle.
        </p>   
      <h2>
        That&rsquo;s because <em>constantly finding leads sucks</em> (billable time).
      </h2>
        <p>
         The fact is, job boards aren't designed for freelancers &mdash; and if you're loaded with billable work, chances are <strong>you don't have time to sort through them every day</strong> &mdash; so once you're finished with a project, you scramble to find work again. This desperation leads to wasted time, or even worse, bad clients <em>(just so you can pay the bills).</em>

          <span>&ldquo;</span>My clients were always my priority, but when I had too much client work, I neglected sales activities and my pipeline suffered. <strong>Since starting with Workshop, I've had an unbroken chain of daily lead generation activity no matter what.</strong> I use my inbox as a to-do list and every day that workshop email is a convenient reminder to get selling.<span>&rdquo;</span>

         It's massively more effective to contact a few opportunities every day than to wait until your schedule (or wallet) is empty to <em>drunkenly gorge</em> on any leads you can get your hands on. But finding the right leads takes time (at least a few hours a day) and as a freelancer or consultant, an hour of your time is worth $100+. That means you're looking at a loss of over $2,000+ billable time per month! 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>In a perfect world, great leads would come to you. Allowing you to save time, and get right to the important part: pitching clients and landing work.</strong></p>
        <p>
          But if you paid someone $<span class="number">10</span>/hour, and they spent <span class="number">2</span> hours a day gathering leads, you'd be looking at $<span class="number">600</span>/month. That's too much money. Finding someone cheaper on odesk is an even bigger waste because the chances of finding quality help are microscopic (plus who wants to hire someone from odesk?). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Skipping the cup of joe in the morning pays for a day of my leads (and you'll wake up to a cup of Rob instead). Ask anyone who's hired lead gen like this, and they'll say it's usually really expensive, like <span class="number">30</span>% of your total sales. So if you landed a $<span class="number">10,000</span> contract, they might ask for $<span class="number">3,000</span>! I have something better: for a small monthly fee, you'll get the best freelance leads sent to your inbox, every day.

          <h2>Allowing you to generate a consistent cash flow for your business.</h2>
          <p>Instead of spending your time looking for leads (or hiring someone expensive to do it for you) simply get them delivered to your email automatically&mdash;so all you have to do is reply to the ones you're interested in. This takes a few minutes (instead of hours) and will give your sales pipeline a constant stream of activity, which lets you focus almost exclusively on billable hours.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Man you are really kicking ass. <strong>I feel like you're doing all of the work and I just get to be all la-tee-da over picking who I reach out to.</strong> Keep up the good work! I've been super pleased with my choice to invest in Workshop. You've proven to be a low-risk way to get more leads to my door and as a busy owner, you're exactly the type of person I want to work with for a long time. Please don't stop!&rdquo;

          <h2 class="quote">“Wait, can't I just find these leads myself, for free?” </h2>
          <p>The leads are available for free but your time is worth money. Technically you could find the leads yourself, but you haven't up to now - and lets be honest - you never will. Committing to finding a set of leads day-in and day-out is tough. That's why you haven't done it consistently &mdash; and the truth is that's why most freelancers would rather update their dribbble, github, and twitter profiles, waiting for work to fall into their lap, than email <em>even one</em> qualified prospect this week. 
          </p>

          <h2 class="quote">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</h2>



<p>
  <img style="border-radius: 50px; float: left; margin-right:20px; height:90px; width: 90px; display: inline-block;" src="robert-williams.png"/> 

  I'm Robert, an experienced freelancer that knows exactly which prospects will be an asset to your business. I've worked with startups, ad agencies, as well as small and large businesses.</p>

<p>I made this service because I wished something like it was available for me, and I'm excited to share it with you. I've spoken at UCSD about design and freelancing &mdash; and would like to help lower your blood pressure by providing you a great service. See you inside!</p> 



<hr>

          <h2 class="quote">&ldquo;How many, and how often (etc.) will leads be sent?&rdquo;</h2>
          <p><strong>Workshop is about less.</strong> Allowing you to do less and get better results.</p>  
          <p>It's just as much about the leads I don't send as it is about the ones I do. The thousands of leads I eliminate from freelancers lives completely, make the handful I do send more important. The fact is you don't need all that many leads to make a lot of money; <strong>you just need the right leads.</strong>  If you're looking for hundreds of freelance leads in your inbox every day, then it's not the right service for you but if you're looking for the best leads - whatever the amount - it is.</p>

          <hr>

<h2 class="quote">&ldquo;Are you any good at finding leads?&rdquo;</h2>
 <p>
 Workshop members think the leads I pick out reply at a higher rate, but the truth is they also have an unfair advantage over you. Job boards no longer suck up all their billable time, so they're actually better at contacting leads because they no longer teeter-totter between work overload and an empty checking account. Some have landed huge projects, or even full-time remote dream jobs from Workshop's short life span. All have saved the most precious thing of all; time.
