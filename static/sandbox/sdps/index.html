<p>Dear Young San Diego Art Student, </p><p>My name is Robert Williams, and like you, I had been dreaming of a job where I could get paid a lot of money to use my creativity.</p> 
<p><strong>I knew a regular, boring, 9-5 office job wasn’t for me.</strong></p>
<p>But every day I would wake up and something got in the way.</p> Frankly, I was tired. I knew the dream was there – but when friends and family would ask, </p><p><em>“What are you up to, are you going to school?”</em></p><p>I’d just gaze at them and say something like: </p><p><em>“Yea it’s coming along, I’m still deciding what to do, I guess.”</em></p><p>The half smile didn’t fool anybody. So for YEARS I’d been telling my family about this mythical career I’d get some day.</p> 
<p>But I didn’t know how to land one, in fact I didn’t even know where to start. </p><p><strong>I want to tell you about what I did and what I learned.</strong></p> 
<p>I enrolled in a $200,000 bachelor’s program for graphic design - and it was fun, I’m not gonna lie. </p><p>I met friends, and learned the basics of the creative industry.</p> 
<p>But on graduation day, I looked back and said: “That was fun. But was it $200,000 of fun?”</p> 
<p>The answer was no.</p><p>I still didn’t have a job, or a great portfolio and I knew I could’ve gotten the same experience, with a better education – and actually landed a great job if there had been more options available. </p><p>During my time at school, one instructor stood out. My mentorship under him, alone, made the school experience worth the price of admission. </p><p>His classes were extremely valuable. His in-class critiques were brutal, honest, and a stark contrast to the gentle hand-holding most of our other classes offered. </p><p>In his classes it felt like you were actually at a real job, probably because Henry was one of the few instructors with real agency experience.</p><p>After graduation, my friends started landing jobs and interviews because of him. </p><p>He went the extra mile and even used his personal connections in the industry to land us interviews months after we graduated. </p><p><strong>Then about a year after graduation, Henry informed me of a wonderful new opportunity.</strong></p> 
<p>He was opening up his own program: the San Diego Portfolio Studio.</p> 

<p>The program would offer:</p>

<p><ul>
	<li>Top courses and instructors for focused on top-level agency quality.</li>
	<li>A personal real-life focused portfolio building curriculum.</li>
	<li>Affordable pricing packages starting at $X,000 per semester</li>
	<li>One-on-one recruiting and placement with top agencies in San Diego.</li>
	<li>Enrollment starting in Fall 2014.</li>
</ul>

<p>Immediately I knew it was the option that I had wished for at graduation.</p><p>Had I gone to SDPS, I would have: 
<ul>
<li>Saved a lifetime of debt</li> 
<li>Avoided the headaches of dealing with a for-profit accounting department</li> 
<li>Skipped layers of bureaucracy in the faculty and curriculum of my private school education.</li>
</ul></p><p>If you are serious about a future in the creative industry, San Diego Portfolio Studio is now your best option. <a style="color: #29A3E4;" href="#">Contact Henry Hikima today to schedule a walk-through.</a> </p><p>Other schools have a fraction of the amount of successful graduates -- and are forced to promote other things like fancy equipment or shiny diplomas. </p><p>The truth is, no one is going to care about your resume or degree, if you don&#39;t have outstanding work. </p><p>Building a great portfolio is hard - but at SDPS, graduating with an upper-hand on virtually every other creative is a guaranteed investment.</p>
