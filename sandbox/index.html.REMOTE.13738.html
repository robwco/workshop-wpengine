      <h2>Constantly finding leads sucks.</h2>

        <p>
          You know that being out of work can make you desperate&mdash;but contacting every lead under the sun only delays your payday. The fact is, job boards aren't designed for freelancers&mdash;so if you're loaded with work,<strong>you just don't have time to look for leads every day.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're like I was, once you finish up a project, you have to scramble to find work again. I know first-hand that this desperation leads to wasted time, or even worse, taking on bad clients <a href="./images/marketing/sharktank.jpg" target="_blank"><em>"just so you can pay the bills".</em></a>
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <span>&ldquo;</span>My clients were always my priority, but when I had too much client work, I neglected sales activities and my pipeline suffered. <strong>Since starting with Workshop, I've had an unbroken chain of daily lead generation activity no matter what.</strong> I use my inbox as a to-do list and every day that Workshop email is a convenient reminder to get selling.<span>&rdquo;</span> &mdash; <a href="http://twitter.com/kurtinc" target="_blank"> Kurt Elster</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://ethercycle.com">Ethercycle</a>

      <h2>Freelancing <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> have to be feast or famine.</h2>

        <p>
         It's way more effective to contact a few opportunities every day so
         <strong>why wait until your schedule (or wallet) is empty to blast every lead in sight?</strong>
       </p>

        <p>
          Don't. Make contacting a few leads part of your daily routine and have a consistent stream of new opportunities at your disposal at all times.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do you find these leads? In a perfect world, they would come to you and you'd get right to the important part: pitching and landing work.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the truth is it takes time to find opportunities online (at least a few hours a day) and doing this yourself means a loss of over of over $2,000+ billable time per month!
          Even if you paid someone just $10 an hour, that would be too much money ($600/month) and they'd most likely be at a loss about what a quality lead even looks like for your business.
        </p>

      <h2>Introducing: Workshop, an affordable <em>hands-free lead-gen service</em> for freelancers and studios...</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of spending your time looking for leads (or hiring someone expensive to do it for you) simply get them delivered to your email automatically&mdash;so all you have to do is reply to the ones you're interested in straight from your inbox. This takes a few minutes (instead of hours) and will give your sales pipeline a constant stream of activity, which lets you focus almost exclusively on billable work.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <span>&ldquo;</span>Man you are really kicking ass. <strong>I feel like you're doing all of the work and I just get to be all la-tee-da over picking who I reach out to.</strong> Keep up the good work! I've been super pleased with my choice to invest in Workshop. You've proven to be a low-risk way to get more leads to my door and as a busy owner, you're exactly the type of person I want to work with for a long time. Please don't stop!<span>&rdquo;</span> &mdash; <a href="https://twitter.com/nhance" target="_blank">Nick Hance</a> | <a href="http://www.reenhanced.com/" target="_blank">Reenhanced</a></span>

      <h2>I sort through thousands of job posts for you and email you the best freelance leads.</h2>
        <p>
          With the countless amounts of <a href="http://stupidjobpost.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">crappy job posts</a>, trust me, you don't want to sort through it all yourself. Not to mention how many new job boards pop up all the time&mdash;you’d be playing a constant game of catch up.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, I'm constantly adding new job board sources&mdash;you can even suggest one, and I'll personally monitor it for you!</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href=“mailto:rob@robw.co?subject=New Job Board”>&rarr; Suggest a job board for me to monitor</a>
        </p>

      <h2>Wait. Can’t I just find these leads myself for free?</h2>
        <p>
          Leads are available for free, but your time is worth money. Technically, you could find the leads yourself, but why haven't you?
        </p>
        <p>
          Committing to finding leads day-in and day-out is tough. The truth is, you’d rather wait for work to fall into your lap, than find even one qualified prospect to email this week.
        </p>

      <h2>Are you any good at finding leads?</h2>
        <p>
          Workshop members think the leads I pick out reply at a higher rate, but the truth is they also have an unfair advantage over you. Job boards no longer suck up all their time, so they're actually better at contacting leads because they no longer teetertotter between work overload and an empty checking account. Some have landed huge projects, or even full-time remote dream jobs. All have saved the most precious resource: time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="./testimonials/" target="_blank">&rarr; Read dozens of testimonials from real Workshop members</a>
        </p>

      <h2>I look over every single lead, personally, to make sure they meet strict criteria:</h2>
        <p>
          They MUST be freelance leads, not full-time work. They MUST be remote, and open to freelancers anywhere. They MUST be quality projects: no budgets below $1,000. And, preferably, there must be an email attached to the lead.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="./connect/" target="_blank">&rarr; Post a project with these criteria to Workshop</a>
        </p>

      <h2>How many leads will be sent, and how often?</h2>
        <p>
          I usually send about 5-10 leads per day, depending on the package you sign up for. Sometimes it will end up being more, <strong>but the whole point of Workshop is that I send fewer, better leads.</strong> I never send a lead just to hit a quota.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, Workshop's value is equally about the leads I don't send as it is about the ones I do. The thousands of leads I eliminate from your life completely make the handful I do send more important.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact is, you don't need all that many leads to make a lot of money; you just need the right leads. If you're looking for hundreds of freelance leads in your inbox every day, then Workshop isn’t the right service for you. But if you're looking for the best leads - whatever the amount - it is.

            I made Workshop because I wished something like it was available for me, and
            I'm excited to share it with you. I've been featured in places like UCSD, Wired, Copyhackers, Gizmodo, Bidsketch, and the Dieline. I'd like to help lower your blood pressure by providing you a
            great service. See you inside!
