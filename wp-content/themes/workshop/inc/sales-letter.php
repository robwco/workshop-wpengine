	<p>Dear ambitious freelance consultant,
	</p>
	<h1>
		<strong>I know it <em>pains you</em> to admit that your business is plagued by dry spells.</strong>
	</h1>
	<p>
		After all, you know first-hand that there are thousands of businesses out there right now who would benefit greatly from hiring you. Not just benefit, possibly even transform their company (and life) forever as a result of working with your consultancy. You know this. The problem is, they don't.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's why <em>it's your duty</em> to find them.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't mean by "content marketing", "social networking", "growth-hacking", and/or "putting your name out there."
	</p>
	<p>
		No, I mean directly reaching out to people that need help with a friendly email or phone call. I know, a revolutionary concept.
	</p>


	<h2>
		But it's not always easy to find the right opportunities–especially when you're already working too many hours.
	</h2>

	<p>
		Doing lead generation on top of running a consulting business sucks.
	</p>
	<p>
		The thought of checking two dozen job boards, or worse: elance, every day for the rest of your career just doesn't sound appealing.
	</p>
	<p>
		You want to do the work you love, not search for it.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's why too many freelancers wait for work to come to them (read: do nothing at all) – because it's easier. That's why we complain about less-than-ideal clients instead of just firing them. That why we think, "I'll do this project just this once to pay the bills this month," and end up working for less than we're worth for years.
	</p>
	<p>
		I know this all too well because I too was in the vicious cycle of <strong>feast or famine freelancing</strong>. Then I did something about it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I read books about pricing and positioning. I took world-class courses on freelancing. I asked experienced six-figure consultants how they found work. I even surveyed hundreds of freelancers, recording thousands of data points on salary and marketing efforts along the way.
	</p>
	<p>
		 Suddenly, it began to click. I realized something that few freelancers ever notice.
	</p>
	<h2>
		People who pitch their services to more qualified prospects simply make more money.
	</h2>
	<p>
		And the ones who don't, get leap-frogged. Each year that they don't have a system for generating qualified prospects, is another year wasted.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of us don't have the benefit of heavily-trafficked websites or tight user-groups that refer work to one another. Most of us have to find our leads online. Still, all successful consultancies find a way to get their foot in the door with new clients regularly.
	</p>

	<p>
		You could do it yourself – but is sorting through thousands of job posts really the best use of your time?
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't think so. There's just too many crappy job posts, too many new job boards that pop up, and you'd be in a constant game of catch up.
	</p>
	<p>
		You could build a team or hire someone to do it for you, but would they be able to do it as well as you? Would they be worth the extra money? A virtual assistant, for example, charges $10/hour (and may lack basic english skills). So you're looking at over $600/month.
	</p>
	<p>
		Don't you wish you could have it done <em>for you</em> each month at a fraction of your hourly rate?
	</p>

	<h2>
		Imagine what you could accomplish today if you didn't have to worry about finding new work.</strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Once you realize this the game changes. I was no different. I suddenly became serious about finding prospects. I built a daily system for collecting their emails and phone numbers. I used twitter, job boards, industry websites, anything that could help me find more prospects.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>High-quality prospective clients that I could build my business (and future) around.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		I then contacted each lead with a custom, highly-specific email and my business took off. In fact my revenue doubled, all from leads I found online.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, if I told you could enjoy the fruits of my labor, instantly skip the years of testing lead generation methods, and just get 10+ highly-qualified leads, what would you do with it?
	</p>
	<p>
		If tomorrow, instead of wasting time looking for leads, you had them sent directly to your email. If all you had to do was reply to the ones you're interested in straight from your inbox. If it took minutes (instead of hours) and you filled your sales pipeline each morning with a constant stream of activity, allowing you to focus almost exclusively on billable work. 
	</p>
	<p>
		What then? Would you add that extra feature to your client's project and blow them away? Would you go for a walk with your child or significant other? Would you work on that side-project you've been itching to build?
	</p>
	<h2>
		Let me sort through thousands of job posts and email you the best leads.
	</h2>

	<p>
		I've designed the service I'm describing for people like you, and I've made it very affordable on purpose. From the day you sign up you'll have the highest quality leads on the web, pre-qualified and sorted into your inbox so that they're easy to scan in minutes.
	</p> 
	<p>
		<strong>"Wait. Can’t I just find these leads myself for free?"</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
		No. Sure some leads are available for free online, but your time is worth money. Of course, you could find the leads yourself, but why haven't you? Committing to finding leads day-in and day-out is tough. The truth is, you’d rather wait for work to fall into your lap, than find even one qualified prospect to email this week.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>
			"Will you be any good at finding leads <em>for me?"</em>
		</strong>
	</p>
		<p>
			<em>I look over every single lead, personally, to make sure they meet a strict criteria:</em> they MUST be freelance leads, not full-time work. They MUST be remote, and open to freelancers anywhere. They MUST be quality projects: no budgets below $1,000. And, preferably, there must be an email attached to the lead.
		</p>
		<p>
			Workshop members think the leads I pick out reply at a higher rate, but the truth is they also have an unfair advantage over you. Job boards no longer suck up all their time, so they're actually better at contacting leads because they no longer teeter-totter between work overload and an empty checking account. Some have landed huge projects, or even full-time remote dream jobs. All have saved the most precious resource: time.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>"How many leads will be sent, and how often?"</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			I usually send 8-10 leads per day. Sometimes it will end up being more, <strong>but the whole point of Workshop is that I send fewer, better leads.</strong> I never send a lead just to hit a quota. In fact, Workshop's value is equally about the leads I don't send as it is about the ones I do. The thousands of leads I eliminate from your life completely make the handful I do send more important.
		</p>
		<p>
			The fact is, you don't need all that many leads to make a lot of money; you just need the right leads. If you're looking for hundreds of freelance leads in your inbox every day, than Workshop isn’t the right service for you. On the other hand if you're looking for the best leads, it is.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>"How long have you been doing this, does it work?"</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			I started doing this with select consultancies in November, 2013. Since then I've helped hundreds land work. Some have even made hundreds of thousands of dollars from my leads. Now, I focus on Workshop full-time, which wouldn't be possible if it didn't produce massive results for my customers:

				<strong>Workshop-exclusive Gigs:</strong> People now come to me to connect with world-class consultancies and freelancers directly.

			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Design and Development Gigs:</strong> I go to all the places people look for freelance designers and developers. The most common types of projects are: wordpress, web or user interface, branding, logos, packaging, infographics, front-end, drupal, javascript, python, django, PHP, back-end, system administration, ruby, rails, CMS, image processing, HTML/CSS, magento, and .NET.
			</li>
		</ul>



		<h2>

		<p>
			<img src="../images/marketing/package-mini-course.png" alt="" style="width: 10em; margin-left: .75em;  " align="right"> Along with the newsletter, I also send you material specifically designed to help you land work.

		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>What to do to get an inbox full of warm leads that are ready to become clients.</li>
			<li>How to be successful with Workshop (or any lead service).</li>
			<li>How to reply to a job post in less than 2 minutes.</li>
			<li>The exact template to use for writing emails (which has made me over $100k).</li>

There's actually a full, thriving pool of people just like you that are eager to help at the drop of a hat should you choose to ask. To make this easier, I've created a discussion community using a brand-new software called groupbuzz (plus a member hipchat). These will be there for real-time connection with other members. Based on how we've used them so far, here's a few ways you can improve your business with these tools:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Get reliable and experience-filled answers to your freelance business's most complex problems (like dealing with a sticky client situation).</li>
		
		<li>Get inspired, share what you're working on, discover awesome resources and expand your network of internet buddies by working together (it's like coworking form your home office).
		</li>

		<li>Ask questions about a ton of topics like; improving your website's sales funnel, filing your end of year taxes, giving discounts, renegotiating scope creep, onboarding new clients, pricing your services perfectly and more.</li>

		<li>Plus get access to my <strong>advanced freelance strategy sessions with world-class consultants</strong> live over google hangouts every month.</li>
