		<h2>
			Because constantly finding leads by yourself sucks.
		</strong></h2>

		<p>
			The fact is, job boards aren't designed for freelancers—so if you're loaded with work, you just don't have time to look for leads. If you're like I was, once you finish up a project, you have to scramble to find work again. I know first-hand this can lead to wasted time, or even worse, taking on bad clients <em>"just so you can pay the bills".</em>
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="small-wrap">
		<h2>
			Freelancing <em>doesn’t</em> have to be feast or famine.
		</h2>

		<p>
			It's way more effective to contact a few opportunities every day so <strong>why wait until your schedule (or wallet) is empty?</strong> Don't. Make contacting a few leads part of your daily routine and have a consistent stream of new opportunities at your disposal at all times.

			How do you find these leads? In a perfect world, they would come to you and you'd get right to the important part: pitching and landing work.
		</p>
		<p>
			But the truth is it takes time to find opportunities online (at least a few hours a day) and doing this yourself means a loss of over of over $2,000+ billable time per month! Even if you paid someone just $10 an hour, that would be too much money ($600/month) and they'd most likely be at a loss about what a quality lead even looks like for your business.

			Introducing affordable <em>hands-free</em> lead-generation.
		</h2>


		<p>
			Instead of spending your time looking for leads (or hiring someone expensive to do it for you) simply get them delivered to your email automatically—so all you have to do is reply to the ones you're interested in straight from your inbox. This takes a few minutes (instead of hours) and will give your sales pipeline a constant stream of activity, which lets you focus almost exclusively on billable work.

		<h2>
			Imagine what you could accomplish today if you didn't have to worry about finding work.
		</h2>

		<p>
			Sorting through thousands of job posts isn't the best use of your time. With the countless amounts of crappy job posts, trust me, you don't want to sort through it all yourself. Not to mention how many new job boards pop up all the time—you’re constantly playing catch up. In fact, I'm constantly adding new job board sources to my services—so you can even suggest one, and I'll personally monitor it for you!

	<section class="small-wrap">
		<h2>
			"Wait. Can’t I just find these leads myself for free?"
		</h2>

		<p>
			No. You see, leads are available for free, but your time is worth money. Technically, you could find the leads yourself, but why haven't you? Committing to finding leads day-in and day-out is tough. The truth is, you’d rather wait for work to fall into your lap, than find even one qualified prospect to email this week.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="small-wrap">
		<h2>
			"Will you be any good at finding leads <em>for me</em>?"
		</h2>

		<p>
			Workshop members think the leads I pick out reply at a higher rate, but the truth is they also have an unfair advantage over you. Job boards no longer suck up all their time, so they're actually better at contacting leads because they no longer teeter-totter between work overload and an empty checking account. Some have landed huge projects, or even full-time remote dream jobs. All have saved the most precious resource: time.

		<p><strong>
			I look over every single lead, personally, to make sure they meet a strict criteria:</strong> they MUST be freelance leads, not full-time work. They MUST be remote, and open to freelancers anywhere. They MUST be quality projects: no budgets below $1,000. And, preferably, there must be an email attached to the lead.
		</p>
	</section>


	<section class="small-wrap">
		<h2>
			"How many leads will be sent, and how often?"
		</h2>

		<p>
			I usually send 8-10 leads per day. Sometimes it will end up being more, <strong>but the whole point of Workshop is that I send fewer, better leads.</strong> I never send a lead just to hit a quota. In fact, Workshop's value is equally about the leads I don't send as it is about the ones I do. The thousands of leads I eliminate from your life completely make the handful I do send more important.
		</p>
		<p>
			The fact is, you don't need all that many leads to make a lot of money; you just need the right leads. If you're looking for hundreds of freelance leads in your inbox every day, than Workshop isn’t the right service for you. On the other hand if you're looking for the best leads, it is.

	<p>
		Hello Ambitious Freelance Consultant,
	</p>
	<p>
		It pains you to admit that your freelance consulting business is plagued by dry spells. You and your team are world-class at what you do, and that's part of the problem. You know just how many businesses could be benefitting from your service. That's because you know jIf any of this resonates with you it's because I too was in your situation.
	</p> 
	<p>
		I was tired of blog posts, comments, and networking sites telling me that <em>I needed to do this</em> or I needed to do that to get more clients. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Then I did something about it. I read books, I took courses on freelancing, I asked more experienced consultants about their tactics, I even surveyed hundreds of freelancers. It all came back to one thing. The people who contacted prospects directly made more money.
	</p> 
		That's when I got serious about reaching out to people. After doubling my revenue, I realized I didn't want to generate a list of leads to contact each week. That's when I started this service. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>You can try Workshop, risk-free, for 30 days.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		If after 30 days you're not completely blown away, I'll send you a full refund.
	</p>

	<hr>
	<h3 class="center">You get a daily newsletter full of potential gigs. ($64/month)</h3>
	<p><img src="../images/marketing/package-newsletter.png" alt="" style="width: 12em; margin-left: .75em;  " align="right">
		The key to the service is the daily leads I'll be sending to your inbox each weekday. From the day you sign up you'll have the highest quality leads on the web, qualified and sorted into you inbox and made easy to scan. </p>
