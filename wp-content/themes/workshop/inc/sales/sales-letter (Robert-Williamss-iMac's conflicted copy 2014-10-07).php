	<h1>
		Does your consultancy have more dry spells than you're comfortable with?
	</h1>
	<p>
		Thousands of businesses out there would benefit dearly from hiring your web design or development consultancy. These businesses could transform their company (and life) forever as a result of working with you. You know this. The problem is, they don't. That's why <em>it's your duty</em> to find them. Not theirs.
	</p>

	<h2>
		But it's not always easy to find the right opportunities – especially when you're already working too much.
	</h2>
	<p>
		Doing lead generation on top of running a consulting business sucks. Checking hundreds of job boards, or worse: elance, every day for the rest of your career just isn't the best use of your time. You want to do the work you love, not search for it.
		</p> 
		<p>That's why too many consultancies wait for work to come to them (read: do nothing at all) – it's just easier. It's why we complain about less-than-ideal clients instead of just firing them. It's also why we take on projects that don't pay us what we're worth. Worst of all it's why we fall into dry spells.
	</p>
	<h2>
		I too was in the vicious cycle of <strong>feast or famine freelancing</strong>. 
	</h2>
	<p>
		Then I did something about it. I built a daily system for collecting their emails and phone numbers. I used twitter, job boards, industry websites, anything that could help me find more prospects. High-quality prospective clients that I could build my business (and my life) around.
	</p>
	<p>
		I then contacted each lead with a friendly, personal email and my business took off. In fact my revenue doubled, helping me build a six-figure consultancy, all from leads I found online.
	</p>
</section>


<section class="mid-wrap">
<!--
	<h1>
		People who pitch their services to more qualified prospects simply make more money.
	</h1>
	<p>
		And the ones who don't, get leap-frogged. Each year that they don't have a system for generating qualified prospects, is another year wasted.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of us don't have the benefit of heavily-trafficked websites or tight user-groups that refer work to one another. Most of us have to find our leads online. Still, all successful consultancies find a way to get their foot in the door with new clients regularly.
	</p>

	<p>
		You could do it yourself – but is sorting through thousands of job posts really the best use of your time?
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't think so. There's just too many crappy job posts, too many new job boards that pop up, and you'd be in a constant game of catch up.
	</p>
	<p>
		You could build a team or hire someone to do it for you, but would they be able to do it as well as you? Would they be worth the extra money? A virtual assistant, for example, charges $10/hour (and may lack basic english skills). So you're looking at over $600/month.
	</p>
	<p>
		Don't you wish you could have it done <em>for you</em> each month at a fraction of your hourly rate?
	</p>
-->

	<h1>
		Imagine what you could accomplish today if you didn't have to worry about finding work.
	</h1>
<!--	<p>
		Once you realize this the game changes. I was no different. I suddenly became serious about finding prospects. I built a daily system for collecting their emails and phone numbers. I used twitter, job boards, industry websites, anything that could help me find more prospects.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>High-quality prospective clients that I could build my business (and future) around.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		I then contacted each lead with a custom, highly-specific email and my business took off. In fact my revenue doubled, all from leads I found online.
	</p>-->
	<p>
		Today, if I told you could enjoy the fruits of my labor, instantly skip the years of testing lead generation methods, and just get 10+ highly-qualified leads every morning, what would you do with it?
	</p>
	<p>
		If tomorrow you didn't waste time looking for leads and had them sent directly to you instead. If all you had to do was reply to them, straight from your inbox. If it took minutes (instead of hours) to fill your sales pipeline each morning. Allowing you to focuse almost exclusively on billable work and still have a constant stream of sales activity.
	</p>
	<p>
		What then? Would you add that extra feature to your client's project and blow them away? Or would you use the free time to go on a walk and clear your head? Or maybe work on that side-project you've been itching to build?

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Workshop-exclusive Gigs:</strong> People now come to me to connect with world-class consultancies and freelancers directly. The only way to get connected to these people is by having an active subscription. These are some of the most valuable leads because often times you're competing with only a handful of people, and the clients are people who want to pay for value.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Agency and Team Gigs:</strong> I look all over the web for people specifically looking to hire a creative agency or team. This includes: requests for proposals, consulting opportunities, copywriting, promotion, project management, and full-service design and development projects.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Design and Development Gigs:</strong> I go to all the places people look for freelance designers and developers. The most common types of projects are: wordpress, web or user interface, branding, logos, packaging, infographics, front-end, drupal, javascript, python, django, PHP, back-end, system administration, ruby, rails, CMS, image processing, HTML/CSS, magento, and .NET.
			</li>
		</ul>



		<h2>
			Plus a mini-course developed to help you land those gigs. ($39 value)
		</h2>

		<p>
			<img src="/images/marketing/package-mini-course.png" alt="" style="width: 10em; margin-left: .75em;  " align="right"> Along with the newsletter, I also send you material specifically designed to help you land work. We'll discuss pricing, email-writing, and the psychology behind replying to leads successfully. You'll learn the exact words to use at every step of the process.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>By the end of this mini-course you'll know...</strong>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What to do to get an inbox full of warm leads that are ready to become clients.</li>
			<li>How to be successful with Workshop (or any lead service).</li>
			<li>How to reply to a job post in less than 2 minutes.</li>
			<li>The exact template to use for writing emails (which has made me over $100k).</li>
			<li>How to get stagnant clients to reply to your emails after weeks of ignoring you.</li>
			<li>How to make sure you hear back from every possible email you send.</li>

			And a members-only groupbuzz discussion community and hipchat chatroom ($199/year value)

There's actually a full, thriving pool of people just like you that are eager to help at the drop of a hat should you choose to ask. To make this easier, I've created a discussion community using a brand-new software called groupbuzz (plus a member hipchat). These will be there for real-time connection with other members. Based on how we've used them so far, here's a few ways you can improve your business with these tools:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Get reliable and experience-filled answers to your freelance business's most complex problems (like dealing with a sticky client situation).</li>
		
		<li>Get inspired, share what you're working on, discover awesome resources and expand your network of internet buddies by working together (it's like coworking form your home office).
		</li>

		<li>Ask questions about a ton of topics like; improving your website's sales funnel, filing your end of year taxes, giving discounts, renegotiating scope creep, onboarding new clients, pricing your services perfectly and more.</li>

		<li>Plus get access to my <strong>advanced freelance strategy sessions with world-class consultants</strong> live over google hangouts every month.</li>
