<h1>How a small but mighty consultancy in Chicago uses Workshop...</h1>
</section>

<section class="mid-wrap">
<p><em>
This is the story of just one of my customers, in hopes that you can see a bit of yourself in his success.</em></p>

<h2>In Chicago, Illinois, a small design and development team work tirelessly to bring you internet entertainment. 
</h2>

<p>You’ve probably seen their viral websites like the calming manatee and rainy cafe without knowing the unsung heroes behind the scenes. 
</p>

<p>Although they’ve mastered the art of making seemingly trivial website ideas go viral – at their core, they’re just a fun design agency doing great work. 
</p>


<p>
Kurt Elster originally founded Ethercycle as a bootstrapped startup and along the way it turned into something else: an agency with bold ideas on how to do things.
</p>

<p>
	They signed up for Workshop in late 2013, and have used it to automate their lead generation and sales cycle, so that they could put the extra time they gained into their own ideas (like hilarious websites that generate tons of passive income).
</p>

<blockquote>
	“If we have an idea for a website and it takes less than a day, we do it. No questions asked. We have optimized and automated other parts of our business so that we don't waste time on tasks we don't add value too, unlike most other agencies. Workshop has been a huge part of that.”
</blockquote>

<h2>
This testing mentality has not only lead to building sensational websites for themselves, but helping their clients earn over  $7.2 million dollars in annual revenue.
</h2>

<p>
Since starting Workshop, they've even put together a product for price-sensitive startups called: <a href="http://websiterescu.es">Website Rescues</a>. (A fantastic example of productizing your consulting service.) 
</p>

<p>
The productized consulting service boils down to Kurt and his team applying 30-40 different performance, usability, and design best practices to improve any site without the time or expense of a full redesign. 
</p>

<p>
It's a result of being able to try new things. Most agencies are too busy having to generate new work all the time that they can't fathom testing a completely new approach to their business model. An experiment which could revolutionize how Ethercycle does business. An experiment where they're working on their own terms instead of someone else's. 
</p>

<h2>
So how exactly has Workshop helped?
</h2>

<blockquote>
"My clients were always my priority but when I had too much client work, I neglected sales activities and my pipeline suffered. Since starting with Workshop, I’ve had an unbroken chain of daily lead generation activity no matter what. I use my inbox as a to-do list and every day that workshop email is a convenient reminder to get selling."
</blockquote>

<p>
Let's take a moment to consider this statement. 
</p>

<p>
By signing up to Workshop you're not only getting access to thousands of potential new clients each year, you're getting access to hundreds of hours of time that you can put back into your business (or other areas of your life).
