<h1>
	Send me your project!
</h1>
<h2>
	Applying takes just minutes and you get instant access to world-class freelancers and studios (without the spam). Starting at $50.
</h2>
<p><strong>Rules for posting a project:</strong></p>
<p>This service is ideal for finding the best freelancer or agency you'll ever work with but here's a few qualifications you must have to apply:</p>
<ul style="width:25em; margin: auto;">
<li>You want to only be contacted by a handful of talented freelancers that specialize in your specific type of project.</li>

<li>You don’t mind paying for someone who will get the job done right, and you have a budget of over $1,000.</li>

<li>You know that the best possible talent may not be in your 10 mile radius, so you don't care where your freelancer works from.</li>

<li>You don’t want to deal with spam from posting your project online.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don't apply if...</strong></p>

<ul style="width:25em; margin: auto;">
<li> You just want to reach a ton of name-less freelancers. or you want to be saddled with 73 applications for your job that will take hours to sort through. For that, try odesk. 
</li>
</ul>

				&ldquo;I had a great response from my listing on Workshop. I had 15 top freelancers contact me within a couple hours and the quality of work was very high. I would've wasted a lot more time and effort finding someone if I had gone the traditional job board route - instead found a solid designer quick!&rdquo;
