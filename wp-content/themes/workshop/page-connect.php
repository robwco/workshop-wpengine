<p>
	That&#39;s how I felt back in December.
</p>
<p>
	I was finished brainstorming my web app <a href="http://deviseapp.com" style=" font-weight: 500;"> Devise</a> but felt stuck.
</p>
<h3>
	I had everything in place. Everything except someone to actually build my app.
</h3>
<p>
	That's when I realized that the wonderful app I had in my head didn't exist yet.
</p>
<p>
	I decided to use Workshop to find a freelancer; and only a few hours after posting my project emails began to boomerang back to my inbox with developer introductions, core competencies, and invites to chat on Skype.
</p>
<p>
	It only took a day to go from feeling lost, with no lead developer to interviewing tons of potential freelancers.
</p>
<p>
	On the first day, I spoke to five developers who sent me proposals.
</p>


<h3>
	Just one month later, my project had come to life.
</h3>
<a href="http://deviseapp.com"><img style="max-width: 290px; margin-right: 1em; margin-left: -4em; display: inline-block;" align="left" src="/images/testimonials/devise-site.png"></a>
<p>
	I now have a working product and have since dipped back into my inbox to reach out to other developers when I need extra help.
</p>
<p>
	It&#39;s a huge relief to know that I can continue growing Devise by hiring through Workshop in the future.
</p>
<p>
	Thanks to Workshop I was able to bring my project to life.
</p>
<p>
	If you&#39;re looking to find a developer or designer, I highly recommend getting in touch below.
</p>

<p>– Marcella</p>

	Instead, I send your project to pre-qualified high-value freelancers and consultants via my daily newsletter. Starting at <strike>$50</strike> <strong>free for sidebar members (limited time)</strong>.
</h2>
<p><strong>Rules for posting a project:</strong></p>
<p>This service is ideal for finding the best freelancer or agency you'll ever work with but here's a few qualifications you must have to apply:</p>
<ul style="width:25em; margin: auto;">
<li>You want to only be contacted by a handful of talented freelancers that specialize in your specific type of project.</li>

<li>You don’t mind paying for someone who will get the job done right, and you have a budget of over $1,000.</li>

<li>You know that the best possible talent may not be in your 10 mile radius, so you don't care where your freelancer works from.</li>

<li>You don’t want to deal with spam from posting your project online.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don't apply if...</strong></p>

<ul style="width:25em; margin: auto;">
<li> You just want to reach a ton of name-less freelancers. or you want to be saddled with 73 applications for your job that will take hours to sort through. For that, try odesk.
</li>
</ul>
