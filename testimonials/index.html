               <p><span>&ldquo;</span>I wrote to two contacts from the first Workshop email I got. I already made an appointment for a Skype call with one of the two. <strong>It’s 50% conversion for now, not bad at all ;)</strong> Looking forward for the new email today.<span>&rdquo;</span>

            <p><span>&ldquo;</span>On the first day I used it, I contacted <span class="number">3</span> prospective clients and got three emails back. One of those turned into a solid gig. It's totally worth it so far. <strong>A big reason why is that I know they'll be 100% freelance-friendly leads and I don't have to do any thinking about whether it makes sense for me to apply or not.</strong> Thanks for creating Workshop!<span>&rdquo;</span>

               <p><span>&ldquo;</span>I feels absolutely amazing not having to check job boards. Wading through all the crappy jobs to find the good ones was tough enough. <strong>I'm no longer stressed about what comes next.</strong> The leads in Workshop are amazing and I look forward to your email everyday. Thanks for a wonderful project.<span>&rdquo;</span></p>
